Mini Project 1:Structured Data

Python

A donors’ dataset is the initial object of this mini project. 
The dataset contains a series of attributes of the potential donors, such as the gender, the wealth rating, and the number of children. 
In this project, I focus on the exploration of the donors’ dataset which is a CSV file (Donors_Data.csv).
