A donors’ dataset is the initial object of this mini project.

Python, NLP, recommendation system

As a final project, a recommendation system based on the reviews is a good choice to explore the structured data and unstructured data. The reviews come from the Kaggle dataset 
(https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews). The dataset consists of over 500,000 rows and 10 columns dating from 1999 to 2012.
